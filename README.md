# GhostAzure

This is a forked version of Ghost. To view Ghost's official README.md, visit this page: <https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost>

This repository is configured to work with Microsoft Azure. To host Ghost on Azure, follow the instructions on my blog post titled [How to Install Ghost on Microsoft Azure](http://www.choskim.me/how-to-install-ghost-on-microsoft-azure/)

## Planned Features 

1. Syntax Highlighting via [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)

## Outstanding Issues 
When Microsoft Azure or Ghost update their configuration or codebase, an error may occur during deploying. If you notice any outstanding issues in this repository, do not pull from it. Wait until all issues have been resolved.
